<! Add quora, IG if you make one, etc>

<p> I'm a third-year math Ph.D. student at University of California, Berkeley, interested in microlocal analysis, partial differential equations, and spectral theory.
  My advisior is <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~zworski/"> Maciej Zworski </a>.</p>
<p> Before coming to Berkeley, I was an undergrad at Massachussets Institute of Technology, where I was on the board of directors of
  <a href="http://dynamit.mit.edu/"> DynaMIT </a>, and taught several classes for the <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/"> Educational Studies Program </a>.</p>
<p> When I'm not doing math, I enjoy calisthenics, skiing, cooking recipes from around the world, watching football, and traveling. </p>
